What Is an Exception?
An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.

Advantages of Exception:

Advantage 1: Separating Error-Handling Code from "Regular" Code

readFile {
    open the file;
    determine its size;
    allocate that much memory;
    read the file into memory;
    close the file;
}
At first glance, this function seems simple enough, but it ignores all the following potential errors.

What happens if the file can't be opened?
What happens if the length of the file can't be determined?
What happens if enough memory can't be allocated?
What happens if the read fails?
What happens if the file can't be closed?


// Beauty of an exception

readFile {
    try {
        open the file;
        determine its size;
        allocate that much memory;
        read the file into memory;
        close the file;
    } catch (fileOpenFailed) {
       doSomething;
    } catch (sizeDeterminationFailed) {
        doSomething;
    } catch (memoryAllocationFailed) {
        doSomething;
    } catch (readFailed) {
        doSomething;
    } catch (fileCloseFailed) {
        doSomething;
    }
}


Advantage 2: Propagating Errors Up the Call Stack
// ExceptionHandlDemo5.java


method1 {
    try {
        call method2;
    } catch (exception e) {
        doErrorProcessing;
    }
}

method2 throws exception {
    call method3;
}

method3 throws exception {
    call readFile;
}


Advantage 3: Grouping and Differentiating Error Types

Using multiple cache set..



Error vs Exception
errors and exceptions represent different types of problems that can occur during program execution.
Errors are usually caused by serious problems that cannot be recovered from, while exceptions are
used to handle recoverable errors within a program.

Checked                           Unchecked Exceptions

If a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception, make it a checked exception. If a client cannot
do anything to recover from the exception, make it an unchecked exception.
