   Array:=> Collection of similar data types.
   Symbol --> []

   Why should I learn Array
   -> To avoid multiple variables usage /declaration

   When I should use array?
   Whenever I want to store more values, I can go with arrays

   How I should use array?
   -> [] is used. There are two ways to create array.

   int[] marks = {90, 89, 78};
   boolean[] results = {true, false, true};
   char[] name = {"a", "b", "c", "d"};               // These are primitive data types - 8 Primitive types
   float[] values = {1.3f, 2.2f};

   Non-primitive Data types arrays:=> Every class we have/create

   String[] names = {"ahali", "mane"}

   Employee emp1 = new Employee();
   Employee emp2 = new Employee();
   Employee emp3 = new Employee();
   Employee emp4 = new Employee();

   Employee[] emp = {emp1,emp2,emp3,emp4}  --> From employee class, USER DEFINED ARRAY

   When we want to create undefined data with array
   int[] marks = new int[6];   | | | | | | |           We have 6 boxes with initial 0 value.

        equivalent to ====

   mark1 = ??
   mark2 = ?? until mark6 (Memory space 6 marks = array marks with [6] memory)

   1) In arrays, values will be stored continuously
   2) Array will have their own default value based on their datatype.
   For example, int array will have 0 as default value.
   for float - 0.0 ,  for boolean - false.

   Array is index based.
   int[] marks = {80, 90, 100};
   Array Element: No. of elements --> 3
   Index starts from 0 and ends at (length-1) 2

   Java Understanding;
   marks[0] = 80;
   marks[1] = 90;
   marks[2] = 100;
