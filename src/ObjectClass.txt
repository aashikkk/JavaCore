Class - OOP Concepts.. Thats why every class support OOP

Abc apdi oru class iruntha by default athu extends Object Class
public class Abc extends Object() {}

Inheritance??

An object of one class acting as an object of another class.

Parent                  Child ch = new Child();

Child object will behave like Parent Object as well.

Abc abc = new Abc();
abc.    // Here abc object can access the Object class methods.
