Nested Loop

Looping  -> Repeated Action

You should write inner loop first, and afterward
think about outer loop

EX:
    1 1 1 1 1   ----> Inner Loop, U need to build this line first then think about below lines. that will be outer loop
    1 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1

    So, Inner loop --> no of columns
        Outer loop --> no of rows.
